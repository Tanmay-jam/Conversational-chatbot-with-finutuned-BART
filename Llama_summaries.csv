"What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are .

"Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information .

Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases .
