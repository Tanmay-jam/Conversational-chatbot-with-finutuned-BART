"hi, george. i'm going to have a job interview next week. could you give me some advice? sure. first of all, it  s very important for you not to be late. job interviewers usually don  t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic. yeah, that's very important. so you  d better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing. so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment. i  ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer. that  s right. you need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes. it  s always easier to say something than to do it. it  s not too difficult to make a good impression. for example, you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed. avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications. but i love wearing t-shirts and jeans. i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview. informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job, or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes. it  s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes. you misunderstood me. clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job, or that you are snobbish or frivolous. i know what you mean. i ought to wear right clothes at the right time. you got it. only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement. it seems that ' clothes make the man '. it may not be true, but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior.","Advice on a job interview: arrive on time, dress modestly, avoid extremes of style, prioritize respect and confidence.","A letter from a young man to his father, in which he asks his father for some advice on how to make a good impression at a job interview.","George asks George's advice for a job interview next week, asking for advice on how to avoid being late and how to make a good impression on the interviewer.
